    <h2>Question one</h2>
    <!--
    Task

    A greeting function is provided for you in the editor below. It has one parameter, . Perform the following tasks to complete this challenge:

    Use console.log() to print Hello, World! on a new line in the console, which is also known as stdout or standard output. The code for this portion of the task is already provided in the editor.
    Use console.log() to print the contents of  (i.e., the argument passed to main).
    You've got this!

    <h2>Question 2 Day(0) - Data Types</h2>
    <!--
    /**
    *   The variables 'firstInteger', 'firstDecimal', and 'firstString' are declared for you -- do not modify them.
    *   Print three lines:
    *   1. The sum of 'firstInteger' and the Number representation of 'secondInteger'.
    *   2. The sum of 'firstDecimal' and the Number representation of 'secondDecimal'.
    *   3. The concatenation of 'firstString' and 'secondString' ('firstString' must be first).
    *
    *	Parameter(s):
    *   secondInteger - The string representation of an integer.
    *   secondDecimal - The string representation of a floating-point number.
    *   secondString - A string consisting of one or more space-separated words.

    <h2>Question three ( Day #1 ) : Arithmetic Operators</h2>
    <!--
    /**
    *   Calculate the area of a rectangle.
    *
    *   length: The length of the rectangle.
    *   width: The width of the rectangle.

    <h2>Question four ( Day #1 ) : Functions</h2>
    <!--
     /*
    *Task
    Implement a function named factorial that has one parameter: an integer,n . It must return the value of  n! (i.e., n factorial).
    *

    <h2>Questions five ( Day #2 ): Functions</h2>
    <!--
    Task

    First, print each vowel in s on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in s.
    Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in s on a new line in the same order as it appeared in s.

    <h2>Question one ( Program structure )</h2>
    <!--
        ** Task
        Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
        #
        ##
        ###
        ####
        #####
        ######
        #######
    -->

    <h2>Question two (Program structure) #FIZZBUZZ Challenge</h2>
    <!--
        FizzBuzz
        
        Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

        When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
    -->

    <h2>Question three #chessboard (Program structure)</h2>
    <!--
        Chessboard
        Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

        Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

        # # # #
        # # # # 
        # # # #
        # # # # 
        # # # #
        # # # # 
        # # # #
        # # # #
        When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.

    <h2>Question four (Functions)</h2>
    <!--
        Recursion
        We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to see whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

        Zero is even.

        One is odd.

        For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

        Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.
